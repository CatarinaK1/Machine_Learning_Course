# Machine Learning utilizing the kNN algorithm

This is a collection the assignments completed for the Predictive Analytics with Python 5cr.  

In this course we learn the basics of machine learning utilizing python as the chosen programming language. In the course's assignments we put into practice:   

- Supervised learning, knn algorithm as an example  
- Unsupervised learning, k-means algorithm as an example  
- Topic detection, regular expressions, Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Sentiment analysis (NLP again)

# Installation  

### Python  

If it is not already installed, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).  

### Jupyter Notebook  
 You should have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using Python's package manager, pip, with the following command:  
 ```
pip install notebook
```
